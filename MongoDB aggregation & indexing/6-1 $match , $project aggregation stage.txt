// Another way to find data using aggregate and $match

db.getCollection("practice-data").aggregate([

    // Stage 1: Match documents where gender is "Male" and age is less than or equal to 30
    { 
        $match: { gender: "Male", age: { $lte: 30 } } 
    },

    // Stage 2: Project (show) the "gender" and "age" fields only
    { 
        $project: { gender: 1, age: 1 } 
    }

])


Then it projects only the gender and age fields in the output.
